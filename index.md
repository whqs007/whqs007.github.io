# About Me
I am a Senior Staff Engineer/Director at Alibaba Cloud, currently leading several kernel development teams for PolarDB. I am engaged in the technical R&D of the cloud-native database, and research in database/system technologies. My main research areas include exploring the next-generation architecture for cloud-native databases, distributed system, and co-design with emergent hardware technologies.
Before joining Alibaba, I was a part of the database team at Baidu. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in 2009 and 2012 both from Zhejiang University.


# Research & Development
[**AliSQL**] I have been leading the kernel development of AliSQL since 2014 and have taken on the role of database kernel leader for Alibaba Group's Double 11 event for many years.

[**X-DB**]I took charge of the kernel R&D for X-DB since 2016. By 2017, X-DB was fully launched and has become the most extensively deployed database system across the entire Alibaba Group. [Additional information](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BCBRewfxCg2i3bDqmHzoLg)

[**PolarDB**] Since 2018, I have dedicated myself to the kernel R&D of PolarDB, leading the development teams of the transaction engine and middleware. My leadership has driven the architectural evolution of PolarDB, encompassing the Distributed Shared-Memory, Serverless, Multi-Primary Architecture, and Consensus Protocol.
